    "Nowadays, every companies use e-commerce to develop their business, especially by using online selling, websites and social media.\n",
    "Understanding customers’ needs is the first priority for any company and business. This way they can find what is their target group and goals, how they can improve their products or services and build their strategy plans around these information. \n",
    "One of the ways for studying costumer behavior in e-commerce is using the reviews and rating they gave to the each product that they purchased online. \n",
    "In this assignment, I am going to analyze the customer reviews on women clothing e-commerce. \n",
    "And I attempt to find the products’ ID which have no recommendation (Recommended IND=0) , and report them so the companies improve these product or stop producing them and come up with new products.\n",
    "And also I try to find a relationship between Rating and Age and Age and Recommendation, and come up with a formula to predict Rating based on Age . Because I believe it is harder to satisfied older women than younger one."
